          <p>I am an beginner full stack Web Developer. I love coffee as well.</p>
          <p>Most of the stuff i have learned come from books and udemy courses, my entire goal when learning web dev was to overcome one barrier and that was a internet restriction software used at my school called securly i also wanted to learn html canvas to make games, i first got intrested in programming in the sixth grade at that time i was just seeing what i should start with and if i liked it after awhile i tried and failed so i gave up but 2 weeks before summer break / the end of the school year i got back into it and i began trying again, i got into web development as i thought it was pretty cool at first i tried learning javascript but then found it was so hard and people said you should start with the foundations of web development so i did good ol html and css (which is what im learning right now) ive been learning html and css for awhile and i cannot wait to jump into javascript and node i might also migrate to ruby on rails after i learn the basics of web development.</p>
